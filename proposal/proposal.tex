\section{Introduction}

Construction of a semantic model for the untyped $\lambda$-calculus had eluded computer
scientists for quite some time when the first solution was given by Dana Scott in
1969~\cite{scott:1969}; he termed the mathematical structures which can be appropriately
regarded as the model of $\lambda$-calculus \emph{domains} hence giving rise to what is now
known as \emph{domain theory}. The key insight in Scott's solution was the formulation of
an \emph{information ordering} between terms of the $\lambda$-calculus that orders them with
respect to ``how defined'' they are and then focus on functions that are \emph{continuous}
with respect to this ordering.

Scott initially formulated this story in the language of order theory. Even though this
approach is elegant and enables a smooth development of the required constructions (for
purposes of semantics), it doesn't express the underlying ideas in their full generality.
To put it in Scott's words~\cite[pg.~577]{scott:1982}:

\begin{quote}
  I feel I made a mistake in 1969 in using Lattice Theory as a mode of
  presentation---a mistake as far as Computer Science is concerned.
\end{quote}

It is for this reason that Scott tried another presentation in 1981 (???) formulating the
notion of \emph{neighborhood systems}, making a direct link with the underlying
topological insights. Even though this approach turned out to simplify the presentation,
Scott thought they left ``too much implicit'' and hence attempted yet another formulation
of the idea of domains, formulating this time the notion of information systems in
1982~\cite{scott:1982}.

Right around the time Scott first devised the theory of domains, a mathematical
development was also taking place: the theory of \emph{abstract} or \emph{synthetic}
topological spaces in which one takes the notion of a ``set of opens'' as a primordial
entity and carries out the development based on the algebraic essence of these opens.
Although the pioneering development in this field was done by Stone~\cite{stone:1934}, it
was in the 1970s that the study of abstract topological spaces became a discipline of
study in its own right with an important paper by John Isbell~\cite{isbell:1973}.

A salient feature of pointless topology that is perhaps the most relevant for purposes of
this thesis is that classical theorems of regular topology can be given constructive
proofs in the pointless setting.
