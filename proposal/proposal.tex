\section{Introduction}

Construction of a semantic model for the untyped $\lambda$-calculus had eluded computer
scientists for quite some time when the first solution was given by Dana Scott in
1969~\cite{scott:1969}; he termed the mathematical structures which can be appropriately
regarded as the model of $\lambda$-calculus \emph{domains} hence giving rise to what is now
known as \emph{domain theory}. The key insight in Scott's solution was the formulation of
an \emph{information ordering} between terms of the $\lambda$-calculus that orders them with
respect to ``how defined'' they are and then focus on functions that are \emph{continuous}
with respect to this ordering.

Scott initially formulated this story in the language of order theory. Even though this
approach is elegant and enables a smooth development of the required constructions (for
purposes of semantics), it doesn't express the underlying ideas in their full generality.
To put it in Scott's words~\cite[pg.~577]{scott:1982}:

\begin{quote}
  I feel I made a mistake in 1969 in using Lattice Theory as a mode of
  presentation---a mistake as far as Computer Science is concerned.
\end{quote}

It is for this reason that Scott tried another presentation in 1981 (???) formulating the
notion of \emph{neighborhood systems}, making a direct link with the underlying
topological insights. Even though this approach turned out to simplify the presentation,
Scott thought they left ``too much implicit'' and hence attempted yet another formulation
of the idea of domains, formulating this time the notion of information systems in
1982~\cite{scott:1982}.

Right around the time Scott first devised the theory of domains, a mathematical
development was also taking place: the theory of \emph{abstract} or \emph{synthetic}
topological spaces in which one takes the notion of a ``set of opens'' as a primordial
entity and carries out the development based on the algebraic essence of these opens.
Although the pioneering development in this field was done by Stone~\cite{stone:1934}, it
was not until the 1970s that the study of abstract topological spaces became a discipline
of study in its own right with an important paper by John Isbell~\cite{isbell:1973}.

\emph{Locale theory} emerged as a refinement of the pointless approach to topology~\cite{%
johnstone:1982} and it was pointed out that it has direct connections to computer
science: it algebraicizes the notion of an \emph{observable property} building upon the
realization that observable properties of programs behave like open sets in a topology. It
was Abramsky~\cite{abramsky:1991} who first took advantage of locale theory for the
elucidation and further transformation of domain theory.

As explained by Abramsky~\cite{abramsky:1991}, there are two interpretations of Stone
duality

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The topological view: \emph{points vs. open sets}
  \item The logical view: \emph{models vs. formulas}
\end{enumerate}

the third one that was put forth by Abramsky is

\begin{center}
  The computer science view: computations and their specifications.
\end{center}

It is a remarkable result that Stone duality, when interpreted in this way, provides the
right framework for understanding the relationship between denotational semantics and
program logic. The fundamental relation of interest in software verification is

\begin{center}
  $P \vDash \phi$ \qquad ``program $P$ satisfies property $\phi$''
\end{center}

The spatial (``pointful'') side of the duality enables us to view types as topological
spaces consisting of points and programs as those points. The localic (``pointless'') side
of the duality provides a ``logical interpretation of denotational semantics'', as a
proof-theoretic system.

\section{Thesis topic}

The development of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)~\cite{hottbook} has been a substantial
advancement throughout the history of type theory, if not all of mathematical foundations.
From the practical point of view, HoTT provides the user access to the following technical
advantages.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Function extensionality}: It is common for Agda programmers to postulate
    function extensionality which is not a theorem of type theory. However, it was proven
    by Voevodsky that function extensionality is a theorem in a univalent setting.
  \item \emph{Homotopy levels}:
  \item \emph{Higher inductive types}:
\end{itemize}

A severe shortcoming of the HoTT has been the fact that univalence needs to postulated. In
light of the view of type theory as a practical programming language, this means that we
do not know how to run programs that make use of univalence.

The computational meaning of univalence was formulated by the development of \emph{cubical
type theory}~\cite{cubicaltt}. This is an amazing result in a sense since this allows a
programmer to prove that insertion sort is (extensionally) equal to quicksort and then a
develop a theory of their programs that use quicksort as though they used insertion sort.
In other words, they can constructively \emph{transport along} the equivalences of these
two algorithms.

The topic I plan to investigate in this thesis is the formalization of

\begin{itemize}
  \item pointless topology and locale theory, and
  \item the reconstruction of domain-theoretic results within the framework of pointless
    topology.
\end{itemize}

I plan to use \emph{cubical Agda}, an extension to the Agda programming language that was
incorporates cubical type theory hence enabling the use of univalence in a constructive
setting.

One of the main goals of my thesis will be illustrating how such a development can benefit
from univalent type theory. I believe there are several points where the use of univalence
and homotopical features will be beneficial for this development.

%% Explain these points.
