\section{Introduction}

Construction of a semantic model for the untyped $\lambda$-calculus had eluded computer
scientists for quite some time when the first solution was given by Dana Scott in
1969~\cite{scott:1969}; he termed the mathematical structures which can be appropriately
regarded as the model of $\lambda$-calculus \emph{domains} hence giving rise to what is now
known as \emph{domain theory}. The key insight in Scott's solution was the formulation of
an \emph{information ordering} between terms of the $\lambda$-calculus that orders them with
respect to ``how defined'' they are and then focus on functions that are \emph{continuous}
with respect to this ordering.

Scott initially formulated this story in the language of order theory. Even though this
approach is elegant and enables a smooth development of the required constructions (for
purposes of semantics), it doesn't express the underlying ideas in their full generality.
To put it in Scott's words~\cite[pg.~577]{scott:1982}:

\begin{quote}
  I feel I made a mistake in 1969 in using Lattice Theory as a mode of
  presentation---a mistake as far as Computer Science is concerned.
\end{quote}

It is for this reason that Scott tried another presentation in 1981 (???) formulating the
notion of \emph{neighborhood systems}, making a direct link with the underlying
topological insights. Even though this approach turned out to simplify the presentation,
Scott thought they left ``too much implicit'' and hence attempted yet another formulation
of the idea of domains, formulating this time the notion of information systems in
1982~\cite{scott:1982}.

Right around the time Scott first devised the theory of domains, a mathematical
development was also taking place: the theory of \emph{abstract} or \emph{synthetic}
topological spaces in which one takes the notion of a ``set of opens'' as a primordial
entity and carries out the development based on the algebraic essence of these opens.
Although the pioneering development in this field was done by Stone~\cite{stone:1934}, it
was not until the 1970s that the study of abstract topological spaces became a discipline
of study in its own right with an important paper by John Isbell~\cite{isbell:1973}.

\emph{Locale theory} emerged as a refinement of the pointless approach to topology~\cite{%
johnstone:1982} and it was pointed out that it has direct connections to computer
science: it algebraicizes the notion of an \emph{observable property} building upon the
realization that observable properties of programs behave like open sets in a topology. It
was Abramsky~\cite{abramsky:1991} who first took advantage of locale theory for the
elucidation and further transformation of domain theory.

A salient feature of pointless topology that is perhaps the most relevant for purposes of
this thesis is that classical theorems of regular topology can be given constructive
proofs in the pointless setting.

\section{Thesis topic}

The development of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)~\cite{hottbook} has been a substantial
advancement throughout the history of type theory. Even though HoTT is of great
philosophical significance, we avoid providing a historical summary as it would likely be
incomplete. Instead, we focus on the practical benefits from the point of view of the
user.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Function extensionality}: It is common for Agda programmers to postulate
    function extensionality which is not a theorem of type theory. However, it was proven
    by Voevodsky that function extensionality is a theorem in a univalent setting.
  \item \emph{Homotopy levels}:
  \item \emph{Higher inductive types}:
\end{itemize}

A severe shortcoming of the HoTT has been the fact that univalence needs to postulated. In
light of the view of type theory as a practical programming language, this means that we
do not know how to run programs that make use of univalence. The computational meaning of
univalence was formulated by the development of \emph{cubical type theory}~\cite{cubicaltt}.

The topic I plan to investigate in this thesis is the formalization of

\begin{itemize}
  \item pointless topology and locale theory,
  \item the reconstruction of domain theory within the framework of pointless topology,
\end{itemize}

using \emph{cubical Agda}, an extension to the Agda programming language that was
incorporates cubical type theory hence enabling the use of univalence in a constructive
setting.

I believe there are several points where the use of univalence and homotopical features
will be beneficial for this development.

%% Explain these points.
