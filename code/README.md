# Formal Topology in Univalent Foundations

This is the [Agda][0] formalisation accompanying the MSc thesis _Formal Topology in
Univalent Foundations_, authored by Ayberk Tosun.

The formalisation has been typechecked using

- version 2.6.1 of Agda and
- version 0.2 of [`agda/cubical`](https://github.com/agda/cubical).

Version 0.2 of `agda/cubical` is included in the `lib` directory so you do not have to
install the right version yourself.

Additionally, a rendering of the formalisation in clickable HTML is included in the `html`
directory.
