Thesis: \textbf{A Reflexive Graph Model of Sized Types}.

Author of Thesis: \textbf{Jannis Limperg}.

\section{Summary}

%% One small paragraph summary of the thesis.
%% What is the topic?
%% What is the type of research done?
%% What is the main result?
The author develops a \emph{rational reconstruction} of the sized types technique that has
been widely used in the world of dependently typed programming. As pointed out justly by
the author, the sized types technique has not had a sound theoretical foundation which has
led to bugs in proof assistants that use this technique. Attempting to provide a more
well-principled foundation for sized type, the author studies sized types through a
minimal \emph{calculus of sized types} that he terms \textsf{Î»ST}.
