  abstract = {This chapter focuses on different aspects of points and spaces. The first act of intuitionism completely separates mathematics from mathematical language, in particular from the phenomena of language that are described by theoretical logic. It recognizes that mathematics is a languageless activity of the mind having its origin in the basic phenomenon of the perception of a move of time, which is the falling apart of a life moment into two distinct things, one of which gives way to the other but is retained by memory. It is found that if the two-ity thus born is divested of all quality, there remains the common substratum of all two-ities, the mental creation of the empty two-ity. This empty two-ity and the two unities of which it is composed constitute the basic mathematical systems. The basic operation of mathematical construction is the mental creation of the two-ity of two mathematical systems acquired and the consideration of this two-ity as a new mathematical system.},

The point of this note is simply to de ne some basic notions of topology in this framework. In particular, we de ne the notion of points of a space, of continuous maps between and of products of two spaces. 0.1 Informal Presentation We de ne a (generalised) Post system as a structure (X; Cov) such that for each x 2 X; Cov x is a family of subsets of X . In term of Post systems, u U means that u can be deduced from the set of axioms" U . One important thing here is that we have a natural example of a generalised inductive de nition. If we represent a derivation of u U as a tree, then the branching of the tree is determined by the size" of the sets in Cov x for x 2 X: 0.2 Predicative Complete Posets Give},

Many classical results of general topology have been already brought into the realm of constructive mathematics by using formal topology and also new light on basic topological notions was gained with this approach which allows distinction which are not expressible in classical topology. Here we give a systematic exposition of one of the main tools in formal topology: inductive generation. In fact, many formal topologies can be presented in a predicative way by an inductive generation and thus their properties can be proved inductively. We show however that some natural complete Heyting algebra cannot be inductively defined.},

This poses a severe limitation on both what is provable and the re-usability of proofs. Recent developments have, however, resulted in cubical type theory, which permits a constructive proof of univalence. The programming language Agda has been extended with capabilities for working in such a cubical setting. This thesis will explore the usefulness of this extension in the context of category theory. The thesis will motivate the need for univalence and explain why propositional equality in cubical Agda is more expressive than in standard Agda. Alternative approaches to Cubical Agda will be presented and their pros and cons will be explained. As an example of the application of univalence, two formulations of monads will be presented: Namely monads in the monoidal form and monads in the Kleisli form. Using univalence, it will be shown how these are equal. Finally the thesis will explain the challenges that a developer will face when working with cubical Agda and give some techniques to overcome these difficulties. It will suggest how further work can help alleviate some of these challenges.},

which the attempt to prove a plausible conjecture leads to a revision not only of the proof,

the proof suggests a revision of the specification, rather than a change to the code. We then
show that a program meeting the revised specification is nevertheless sufficient to solve the

On the other hand, the influence of domain theory on formal topology is twofold. Historically, the presence of the subset Con in Scott's information systems has been the starting point for the introduction of the positivity predicate Pos in formal topology; also, the notion of approximable mapping has influenced the definition of continuous relations between formal topologies. Conceptually, since domain theory can be seen as a particular case, any notion and result in domain theory becomes a challenge for formal topology: how much of domain theory can be generalized to formal topology? My impression is that some open problems in one of the two fields could already have a solution in the other, and that is why an intensification of contact should be rewarding.1 1I am very grateful to the organizers of the workshop Domains IV, in particular to Dieter Spreen, for inviting me.},

The kinds of spaces needed for denotational sematics involve not only spaces of higher type (e.g. function spaces) but also spaces defined recursively (e.g. reflexive domains). Also required are many special domain constructs (or functors) in order to create the desired structures. There are several choices of a suitable category of domains, but the basic one which has the simplest properties is the one sometimes called consistently complete algebraic cpo's. This category of domains is studied in this paper from a new, and it is to be hoped, simpler point of view incorporating the approaches of many authors into a unified presentation. Briefly, the domains of elements are represented set theoretically with the aid of structures called information systems. These systems are very familiar from mathematical logic, and their use seems to accord well with intuition. Many things that were done previously axiomatically can now be proved in a straightfoward way as theorems. The present paper discusses many examples in an informal way that should serve as an introduction to the subject.},

  abstract = {These notes were originally written for lectures on the semantics of programming languages delivered at Oxford during Michaelmas Term 1980. The purpose of the course was to provide the foundations needed for the method of denotational semantics; in particular I wanted to make the connections with recursive function theory more definite and to show how to obtain explicit, effectively given solutions to domain equations. Roughly, these chapters cover the first half of the book by Stoy, and he was able to continue the lectures the next term discussing semantical concepts following his text.},

  abstract = {The paper (first written in 1969 and circulated privately) concerns the definition, axiomatization, and applications of the hereditarily monotone and continuous functionals generated from the integers and the Booleans (plus “undefined” elements). The system is formulated as a typed system of combinators (or as a typed λ-calculus) with a recursion operator (the least fixed-point operator), and its proof rules are contrasted to a certain extent with those of the untyped λ-calculus. For publication (1993), a new preface has been added, and many bibliographical references and comments in footnotes have been appended.},
