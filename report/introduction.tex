\paragraphsummary{State what topology is about.}
This thesis is about topology, the branch of mathematics that studies \emph{continuous}
functions. The notion of a continuous function pervades practically all of mathematics, as
pointed out by JJ Sylvester: ``if I were asked to name, in one word, the pole star round
which the mathematical firmament revolves, the central idea which pervades the whole
corpus of mathematical doctrine, I should point to Continuity as contained in our notions
of space, and say, it is this, it is this!''~\cite[pg. 27]{armstrong-topology}. Let us
then start by considering the question of what continuity is.

\paragraphsummary{$\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of continuity.}
A continuous function, in the context of real numbers, is a function for which
``small changes to the input result in small changes to the output''. This is
formally expressed in the following ``$\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition'' of continuity: a
function $f : \reals{} \rightarrow \reals{}$ is
\emph{continuous} if
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:cont-0}
  \forall x \in \reals{}.~ \forall \epsilon > 0.~ \exists \delta > 0.~ \forall y \in \reals{}.~
    0 < | x - y | < \delta \rightarrow | f(x) - f(y) | < \epsilon.
\end{equation*}
This definition embodies the idea that, to make $f(x)$ closer than $\epsilon$ to
$f(y)$, it suffices to make $x$ closer than $\delta$ to $y$, for some certain $\delta$.

\paragraphsummary{Generalise the notion of distance.}
To pinpoint the essence of continuity, we will generalise this. First, notice that the
function
\begin{equation*}
  d(\pair{x}{y}) = | x - y | : \reals{} \times \reals{} \rightarrow \reals{}
\end{equation*}
is just a \emph{special} notion of distance between inhabitants of the set of interest, namely,
$\reals{}$. There are many other sets whose elements can be viewed as points in a space.
For instance $\reals{}^2$ with the usual notion of distance between two points in the
two-dimensional plane has the corresponding distance function:
\begin{equation*}
  d(\pair{x_0}{y_0} , \pair{x_1}{y_1}) = \sqrt{(x_0 - x_1)^2 + (y_0 - y_1)^2}.
\end{equation*}
We can therefore formulate continuity for any set $X$ which admits a notion of distance
between two points. Formally, we require an appropriate function $d : X \times X \rightarrow \reals{}$.
Such a set endowed with a distance function will be called \emph{metric space} if it
satisfies certain axioms that ensure that the distance function is well-behaved i.e.,
behaves properly like a notion of distance. For instance, we may expect that $d(x, y) =
d(y, x)$ for any two points $x, y \in X$. The specifics of these axioms are not central to
our focus so we will refrain from formulating those. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two metric spaces.
Now we define continuity for any function $f : X \rightarrow Y$:
\begin{equation}\label{cont-1}
  \forall x \in X.~ \forall \epsilon > 0.~ \exists \delta \in X.~ \forall y.~ d_X(x, y) < \epsilon \rightarrow d_Y(f(x), f(y)).
\end{equation}
Now we can express continuity of a function on any set that is behaves like a space.

\paragraphsummary{Transition to balls.}
Notice that we could have written (\ref{cont-1}) in an alternative way. Given
some $x, \epsilon \in \reals{}$ define
\begin{equation*}
  \ball{x}{\epsilon} := \{ y \in \reals{}~|~d(x, y) < \epsilon \}.
\end{equation*}
Now, the following is the same as \ref{cont-1}.
\begin{equation*}
  \forall x \in X.~ \forall \epsilon > 0.~ \exists \delta > 0.~ \forall y \in X.~ y \in \ball{x}{\epsilon} \rightarrow f(x) \in \ball{f(x)}{\delta},
\end{equation*}
which could be expressed even more compactly as:
\begin{equation}\label{cont-2}
  \forall x \in \reals{}.~ \forall \epsilon > 0.~ \exists \delta > 0.~ f(\ball{x}{\epsilon}) \subseteq \ball{f(x)}{\delta}.
\end{equation}

\paragraphsummary{Approximations.}
After having written down continuity in this more compact way, we consider the question:
what is the meaning of $\ball{x}{\epsilon}$? Given some $x \in X$, $\ball{x}{\epsilon}$ expresses the set
of things that are closer than $\epsilon$ to $x$. One intuitive reading of this is that
$\ball{x}{\epsilon}$ denotes the \emph{set of approximations of $x$ with a degree of accuracy of
  $\epsilon$}. As $\epsilon$ decreases, the accuracy with which $\ball{x}{\epsilon}$ represents $x$ increases.
Consider, for instance, $\pi$ whose digits we cannot fully write down. We can, however,
obtain arbitrarily precise expansions of it such as $\ball{\pi}{10^{-10}}$, if we are
willing to wait long enough.

\paragraphsummary{Distance is not needed.}
To see continuity in its full generality, we now notice that the notion of distance is not
crucial to what is expressed in (\ref{cont-2}). We have made use of the distance function
just to be able to express the approximation sets. Instead, we can work directly with a
specification of what the approximation sets are. This is the main idea underlying
topology: we study spaces not through distance but through approximations.

\paragraphsummary{Axiomatisation of basis.}
We mentioned that certain metric space axioms ensure that the distance function is
well-behaved. When one defines approximation sets in terms of such a distance function, it
is guaranteed that they will be well-behaved as well. As we want to completely remove our
dependency on a notion of distance, we will have to axiomatise instead the behaviour of
approximation sets themselves. Consider again the example of $\pi$. It must clearly be the
case that any approximation set for $\pi$ contains $\pi$ itself. In other words, we want
approximations to give us ``error bars'' around some result and if the result is not
within the error bars they are clearly not well-behaved. Furthermore, if we have two
approximation sets for $\pi$, say $A_0$ and $A_1$, $\pi$ must be lie in $A_0 \cap A_1$. We can
then pick out a \emph{finer}, more accurate approximation $A_2$ for $\pi$ such that $\pi \subseteq A_1
\cap A_2$. For instance, $A_0$ might say that $\pi$ lies within $3.0$ and $3.2$ and $A_1$ that it
lies within $3.1$ and $3.5$ from which we can tell that it lies within $3.1$ and $3.2$.
This will be the second requirement. The standard term in topology for such a class of
sets is a \emph{basis for a topology}. We now summarise it precisely in the following
definition.

\begin{defn}[Basis for a topology]
  Given a set $X$, a basis for a topology on $X$ is a class $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of
  $X$ such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\forall x \in X.~ \exists B \in \mathcal{B}.~x \in B$, ``approximations approximate''; and
    \item $\forall x \in X.~ \exists B_0, B_1 \in \mathcal{B}.~ x \in B_0 \cap B_1 \rightarrow \exists B_2 \subseteq (B_0 \cap B_1).~
      x \in B_2$, ``approximations can be refined''.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\paragraphsummary{Topology generated by a basis.}
We will then say that the topology generated by basis $\mathcal{B}$ on $X$ is the class
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{T}(\mathcal{B}) \quad\is\quad \{ U \cup V~|~U, V \in \mathcal{B} \},
\end{equation*}
namely, the closure of the basis under union.

\paragraphsummary{Continuity with bases.}
Now, we can reformulate continuity in a more general way using basis elements. Given a
sets $X, Y$ with bases $\mathcal{B}_X, \mathcal{B}_Y$, a function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is
continuous if
\begin{equation}\label{cont-basis}
  \forall x \in X.~ \forall V \in \mathcal{B}_Y.~ f(x) \in V \rightarrow \exists U \in \mathcal{B}_X.~
    f(U) \subseteq V.
\end{equation}
This says exactly the same thing as (\ref{cont-2}), but talking directly about some given
approximation sets rather than defining these through a notion of distance. In other
words, we previously said that a function is continuous if we can make $f(x)$ closer than
$\epsilon$ to $f(y)$ by making $x$ closer than $\delta$ to $y$. We are now saying that for every
set approximating some $f(x)$, there is a set approximating $x$ such that the image of
the latter is contained in the former, which corresponds directly to (\ref{cont-2}).

\paragraphsummary{Motivate topologies.}
There is only one more step remaining until we reach the standard, most general definition
of a topology.
%% TODO: complete.

\begin{defn}[Topological space]
  A topology on a set $X$ is a class $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ such that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The trivial subsets $X, \emptyset \subseteq X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$,
  \item $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under finite intersections, and
  \item $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under arbitrary unions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\paragraphsummary{Transition to pointless topology.}
From the perspective where we view topology as a mathematical theory of finitary
approximations, it makes further sense to take the notions of approximation as primitive
and then investigate them directly instead of defining them as \emph{derived notions} that
are defined as certain kinds of ``sets of points''. This is analogous to the distinction
between analytic and synthetic geometry: in the former, one defines a space as a set of
points, whereas in the latter one works directly with constructs on spaces such as angles,
lines, and circles.

\paragraphsummary{Motivate frames.}
In pointless topology, we start with a set $\mathcal{O}$ of opens. We then axiomatise
directly how these opens shall behave.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Corresponding to the set-inclusion partial order in the pointful case, we require that
    there be a partial order $\_\sqsubseteq\_ \subseteq \mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{O}$.
  \item Corresponding to the fact that open sets are closed under finite intersection, we require
    that there be a binary meet operation $\_\sqcap\_ : \mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{O} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}$ and a
    nullary one $\top : \mathcal{O}$.
  \item Corresponding to the fact that open sets are closed under arbitary union, we require that
    there be a join operation of arbitrary arity: $\bigcup\_ : \pow{\mathcal{O}} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}$.
\end{enumerate}
In addition to this, require that these operations satisfy the distributivity law.
%% TODO: complete.
Such a set $\mathcal{O}$ that satisfies these four conditions is called a \emph{frame}.
Historically, it has occurred to multiple mathematicians that topological questions can
be entertained in this pointless manner.

\paragraphsummary{Motivate formal topology.}
The goal of carrying out topology in type theory presents further challenges: we must do
it not only constructively but also \emph{predicatively}. To address this problem, we will
work with presentations of frames that we will call \emph{formal topologies}. The idea is
that a formal topology is like a formal proof system that allow us to deal with our
topology as though it were a proof system in which one proves theorems by applying rules.
We remarked that the point of pointless topology is that it allows us to constructively
understand results of topology. Formal topology provides us the further advantage of
being able to understand them predicatively.

\paragraphsummary{Explain the goal of the thesis.}
In this thesis, we present a development of formal topology in \UF{}. By now, it has
become clear that univalence addresses many shortcomings of type theory therefore the
question of what novelties it presents for the question of topology in type theory is a
natural one. We focus on one particular approach to formal topology, using certain partial
orders endowed with a ``discipline'' structure, an idea going back to
Coquand~\cite{coq-posets}.

\paragraphsummary{Summarise the thesis structure.}
This thesis is structured as follows. In Chapter~\ref{chap:foundations}, we summarise the
fundamentals of \UF{}. In Chapter~\ref{chap:frames}, we present our development of frames
and constructs related to them in preparation for Chapter~\ref{chap:formal-topo} in which
we present our development of main development of formal topology in \UF{}. In
Chapter~\ref{chap:domain-theory}, we develop some Domain Theory and denotational semantics
as a branch of formal topology.
