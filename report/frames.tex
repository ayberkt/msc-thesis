\chapter{Frames}\label{chap:frames}

In this chapter, we develop the notion of a frame in \UF{}. In Chapter~\ref{chap:intro},
we explained that a frame is the algebra of a logic of finitely verifiable properties.
Recall that a frame consists of the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a set $O$ of \emph{opens},
  \item a partial order $\_\sqsubseteq\_ \subseteq O \times O$, corresponding to the set-inclusion order of the
    open subsets,
  \item finite meets, and
  \item arbitrary joins.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these, there is a law that is needed to ensure the correct interplay
between meets and joins. Suppose that we have the observable property $\phi$ and the family
of observable properties $\psi_0, \psi_1, \cdots$. Consider the expression:
\begin{equation*}
  A \cap (\bigcup_i B_i).
\end{equation*}
where $A$ is a set and $B$ is a family of sets. By set-theoretic reasoning, this is the
same thing as:
\begin{equation*}
  \bigvee_i (\phi \wedge \psi_i).
\end{equation*}
As we are trying to characterise the behaviour of open ``sets'' without defining them as
sets of points, we have to explicitly add this distributivity law into the definition of
frame:
\begin{center}
  \emph{binary meets must distribute over arbitrary joins.}
\end{center}

As a brief digression, let us note that it is natural to consider the question: what
happens if we leave out this requirement of distributivity? The resulting structure is
called a \emph{basic topology} and is studied in the work of Sambin

\paragraphsummary{Structure of chapter.}
We now start presenting our formal development of frames. We start with partially ordered
sets in Section~\ref{sec:poset}, which underlie frames. In Section~\ref{sec:frame}, we
present the definition of a frame. In Section~\ref{sec:frame-univ}, we present an
important theorem unique to \UF{}: isomorphic frames are equal. In Sections
\ref{sec:down-set-frame} and \ref{sec:nuclei}, we prove two important theorems in
preparation for the succeeding Chapter~\ref{chap:formal-topo} on formal topology: (1) the
set of downward-closed subsets of a poset forms a frame and (2) given a nucleus (a
technical notion to be introduced) on a frame, its set of fixed points is itself a frame.

\section{Partially ordered sets}\label{sec:poset}

\begin{defn}[Poset]\label{defn:poset}
  Given some $\oftyI{A}{\univ{}_m}$, let $\order{n}{A} \is A \rightarrow A \rightarrow \hprop{}_n$. Notice the
  generality of the universes: the codomain of the relation is permitted to be on a level
  different than that of the carrier set. A poset at carrier level $m$ and relation level
  $n$ is then defined as:
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathsf{Poset}_{m, n} \quad\is\quad \sigmaty{A}{\univ_m}{\posetstr{n}{A}},
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{center}
  where
  \end{center}
  \begin{align*}
    \posetstr{n}{A} \quad\is&\quad \sigmaty{R}{\order{n}{A}}{\posetax{A, R}}\\
    \posetaxnm \quad:&\quad \pity{A}{\univ{}_m}{\order{n}{A} \rightarrow \univ_{\max(m, n)}}\\
    \posetax{A, R} \quad\is&\quad ~\pity{x}{A}{R(x, x)}\\
                      \times&~\pity{x~y~z}{A}{R(x, y) \rightarrow R(y, z) \rightarrow R(x, z)}\\
                      \times&~\pity{x~y}{A}{R(x, y) \rightarrow R(y, x) \rightarrow x =_A y}\\
                      \times&~\isaset{A}
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

\paragraphsummary{Clarify notation.}
Given a poset $P$, we will refer to its relation as $\_\sqsubseteq_P\_$ (in cases where there might
be ambiguity) and the underlying set of $P$ as $\abs{P}$. Notice that the fourth component
of $\posetax{A, R}$ requires the carrier set to be an \hyperref[defn:hset]{h-set}.

Given a poset $P$ we will talk about its \emph{downward-closed subsets}: sets that include
all elements below their elements. This notion embodies the idea of verification at a
certain stage of information. Take a certain element $x : \abs{P}$, that we view as a
stage of information. For some other $y~:~\abs{P}$, $y \sqsubseteq x$ expresses the idea that $y$ is
a \emph{more refined} stage of information i.e., it contains more information hence ruling
out more approximations meaning it admits \emph{less}. Let $U$ be a subset of $\abs{P}$.
The property that $U$ is downward-closed is then expressed as:
\begin{equation*}
  x \epsilon U \rightarrow y \sqsubseteq x \rightarrow y \epsilon U,
\end{equation*}
the intuitive reading of which is: $U$ contains all stages that are ramifications of the
stages it contains. This means that $U$ is an \emph{observable} property: it is secured at
a certain stage in the sense that the reception of more information does not disrupt it.
Let us write this down formally.
\begin{defn}[Downward-closed subset]\label{defn:dc-subset}
  We first define a predicate expressing that a given subset of $P$ is downwards-closed:
  \begin{align*}
    \isdcnm{}   &\quad:\quad  Poset_{m, n} \rightarrow \pow{\abs{P}} \rightarrow \Omega\\
    \isdc{P, U} &\quad\is{}\quad \pity{x~y}{\abs{P}}{x \in U \rightarrow y \sqsubseteq x \rightarrow y \in U}.
  \end{align*}
  By multiple appeals to Proposition~\ref{prop:pi-prop}, it suffices to show that the
  inner-most expression inside the nested $\prod$ type is propositional which is immediate
  since the codomain of $U$ is \hyperref[defn:hprop]{propositional}. We then define the
  type of downwards-closed subsets of a poset as:
  \begin{align*}
    \dcsubsetnm{} &\quad:\quad \mathsf{Poset}_{m, n} \rightarrow \univ_{\max(m+1, n)}\\
    \dcsubset{P}  &\quad\is{}\quad \sigmaty{U}{\pow{\abs{P}}}{\isdc{P, U}}.
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

So far we have dealt with two notions of \emph{observable property} throughout the
development:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item element of a poset which we will eventually view like pointless versions of an
    open set with the order corresponding to the subset-inclusion order, and
  \item the notion of downwards-closed subset which expresses that a property of the poset
    of opens behaves like an observational property.
\end{enumerate}
We will now start relating these two by showing that the set of downwards-closed subsets
of a poset is itself a poset, and indeed, we will prove later (in
Sec.~\ref{sec:down-set-frame}) that it actually forms a frame meaning downwards-closed
subsets satisfy our expectations from properties we view as observable.

Let us start by showing that $\dcsubset{P}$ is a set.
\begin{prop}\label{isSetDCSubset}
  $\dcsubset{P}$ is a set for every poset $P$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  By Proposition~\ref{prop:sigma-set}, it suffices to show that $\pow{\abs{P}}$ is a set
  and $$\isdc{P, U}$$ is a set for every $\oftyI{U}{\pow{\abs{P}}}$. The former holds by
  Proposition~\ref{prop:pow-set}. For the latter, observe that every $\isdc{P, U}$ is a
  proposition by definition meaning it is also set by Proposition~\ref{prop:prop-is-set}.
\end{proof}

Now we can proceed to construct the poset of downwards-closed subsets.
\begin{thm}(Poset of downward-closed subsets)
  Let $P$ be a poset. The type $\dcsubset{P}$ forms a poset under the
  inclusion relation.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  The fact that $\dcsubset{P}$ is a set is given by Proposition~\ref{isSetDCSubset} so it
  suffices to show that the poset axioms are satisfied. Reflexivity and transitivity are
  immediate. For antisymmetry, let $U, V \in \pow{\abs{P}}$ and assume $U \subseteq V$, $V \subseteq U$. By
  function extensionality, it suffices to show that for every $x : \abs{P}$, $U(x) =
  V(x)$. Since $\oftyII{U(x)}{V(x)}{\Omega}$, it is sufficient to show $U(x) \leftrightarrow V(x)$ which is
  immediate
  by assumptions.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Monotonic functions}

The morphisms between two partially ordered sets are monotonic functions.

\begin{defn}[Monotonic function]
  Let $P, Q$ be posets. A function $f : \abs{P} \rightarrow \abs{Q}$ is monotonic if the following
  type is inhabited:
  \begin{equation*}
    \ismonotonic{f} \quad\is\quad \pity{x~y}{\abs{P}}{x \sqsubseteq_P y \rightarrow f(x) \sqsubseteq_Q f(y)}.
  \end{equation*}
  We collect the type of monotonic functions between $P$ and $Q$ in the following type:
  \begin{equation*}
    \monotonicmap{P}{Q} \quad\is\quad \sigmaty{f}{\abs{P} \rightarrow \abs{Q}}{\ismonotonic{f}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Poset isomorphism]
  An isomorphism between two posets is a monotonic function with a monotonic inverse.
\end{defn}

\section{Definition of a frame}\label{sec:frame}

We now proceed to define frames.
\begin{defn}[Frame]\label{defn:frame}
  A frame structure on some type $A$ consists of (1) a poset structure, (2) a top element
  (3) a binary meet operation, and (4) a join operation of arbitrary arity, which we
  define using families:
  \begin{equation*}
    \rawframestr{n}{o}{A} \quad\is\quad \posetstr{n}{A} \times A \times (A \rightarrow A \rightarrow A) \times (\sub{o}{A} \rightarrow A).
  \end{equation*}
  This raw structure must be subject to the following axioms
  \begin{align*}
    \frameax{\sqsubseteq, \top, \wedge, \bigvee} \quad&\is\quad
      \mathsf{IsTop}(\top) \times \mathsf{IsGLB}(\wedge) \times \mathsf{IsLUB}\left( \bigvee \right)
      \mathsf{IsDistr}(\wedge, \bigvee)\\
    \mathsf{isTop}(\top) \quad&\is\quad \pity{x}{A}{x \sqsubseteq \top}\\
    \mathsf{isGLB}(\wedge) \quad&\is\quad \pity{x~y}{A}{(x \wedge y \sqsubseteq x) \times (x \wedge y \sqsubseteq y)}\\
                       &\hspace{0.5em}\times\quad \pity{z~~}{A}{(z \sqsubseteq x) \times (z \sqsubseteq y) \rightarrow z \sqsubseteq x \wedge y}\\
    \mathsf{isLUB}\left(\bigvee\right) \quad&\is\quad
         \pity{F}{\sub{n}{A}}{\pity{x}{A}{x \epsilon F \rightarrow x \sqsubseteq \bigvee_i F_i}}\\
         &\hspace{0.5em}\times \pity{F}{\sub{n}{A}}{\pity{x}{A}{
               \left( \pity{y}{A}{y \epsilon F \rightarrow y \sqsubseteq x}\right) \rightarrow \bigvee_i F \sqsubseteq x
             }}\\
    \mathsf{isDistr}(\wedge, \bigvee) \quad&\is\quad
      \pity{x}{A}{\pity{F}{\sub{n}{A}}{
          x \wedge \bigvee_i F_i} =_A \bigvee_i \left( x \wedge F_i \right)
      }
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
  For every raw frame structure $(\sqsubseteq, \top, \wedge, \bigvee)$, $\frameax{\sqsubseteq, \top, \wedge, \bigvee}$ is a proposition.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  By Proposition~\ref{prop:sigma-prop}, it suffices to show that each component is an
  h-prop. For $\mathsf{isTop}$, $\mathsf{isGLB}$, and $\mathsf{isLUB}$ this can be
  concluded by using Proposition~\ref{prop:sigma-prop} and Proposition~\ref{prop:pi-prop}.
  For $\mathsf{isDistr}$, we use Proposition~\ref{prop:pi-prop} followed by the fact that
  the underlying set of a poset is an h-set (by the definition of $\posetaxnm{}$ from
  Definition~\ref{defn:poset}).
\end{proof}

\section{Isomorphic frames are equal}\label{sec:frame-univ}

\todo{
  Prove that isomorphic frames are equal using the structure identity principle developed
  in Section~\ref{sec:sip}. This will consist in showing that definition of a frame with
  frame isomorphism forms a standard notion of structure and that frame axioms are
  propositions.
}

\section{Frame of downward-closed subsets}\label{sec:down-set-frame}

We have shown how to construct the poset of downwards-closed subsets from a given poset.
We will now show that this in fact forms a frame. We will interpret this frame of
downward-closed subsets as taking a set of stages of information, ordered with respect to
how refined they are, and then focusing on the ones that are downward-closed i.e.,
containing their ramifications.

\begin{thm}
  Given a poset $P$, its poset of downward-closed subsets forms a frame.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  We start by defining the following $\top, \wedge, and \bigvee$ operations:
  \begin{align*}
    \top       \quad&\is\quad \top_A   && \text{(as in Definition~\ref{defn:full-set})}               \\
    U \wedge V   \quad&\is\quad U \cap V && \text{(as in Definition~\ref{defn:set-intersection})}       \\
    \bigvee \bF{} \quad&\is\quad \lambda x.~ \trunc{\sigmaty{i}{\indexset{\bF{}}}{x \epsilon \bF{}_i}}
  \end{align*}
  Notice that $\top$ and $\cap$ can immediately be seen to be propositional whereas $\bigvee$ requires
  a truncation to be forced to be propositional.

  We now proceed to show that these subsets we have defined are indeed downwards-closed.
  $\top_A$ is trivially downward-closed. Downward-closure of $U \cap V$ follows immediately from
  the downward closure of $U$ and $V$. This is also immediate: if $x$ is in $\bigvee \bF{}$
  where $\bF{}$ is a family of downward-closed subsets, $x$ must belong to a particular
  $\bF{}_i$ which will contain any $y \sqsubseteq x$ meaning $\bigvee \bF{}$ itself will contain any $y \sqsubseteq
  x$. The LUB and GLB properties follow from the fact that subsets of a type form a
  lattice as shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:foundations}.

  It remains to be shown that the distributivity law is satisfied. Let $U$ be a
  downwards-closed subset and $\bF{}$, a family of downward-closed subsets. We must show
  \begin{align*}
    U \cap \left(\lambda x.~ \trunc{\sigmaty{i}{\indexset{\bF{}}}{x \epsilon \bF{}_i}}\right) &=
      \bigvee \left( \left( \lambda x.~ \trunc{\sigmaty{i}{\indexset{\bF{}}}{x \epsilon \bF{}_i}}\right) \cap U \right)\\
      &= \bigvee \left( \lambda x.~ \trunc{\sigmaty{i}{\indexset{\bF{}}}{x \epsilon \bF{}_i}} \cap x \epsilon U \right)
  \end{align*}
  which follows by antisymmetry.
\end{proof}

\section{Nuclei and their fixed-points}\label{sec:nuclei}

To prepare for formal topology, we will now define a technical notion called a
\emph{nucleus}.

\begin{defn}[Nucleus]\label{defn:nucleus}
  Let $F : \mathsf{Frame}_{m, n, o}$ and $j : \abs{F} \rightarrow \abs{F}$ and endofunction on it.
  We say that $F$ is nuclear if the following condition holds:
  \begin{align*}
    \isnuclear{j} \quad&\is\quad
       \pity{x~y}{\abs{F}}{j(\meet{x}{y}) = \meet{j(x)}{j(y)}}       \\
      &\hspace{0.6em}\times\quad \pity{x~~}{\abs{F}}{x \sqsubseteq j(x)}                     \\
      &\hspace{0.6em}\times\quad \pity{x~~}{\abs{F}}{j(j(x)) \sqsubseteq j(x)}.
  \end{align*}

  A nucleus is then just a $\sum$ type collecting nuclear endofunctions on a frame:
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathsf{Nucleus} \quad\is\quad \sigmaty{j}{\abs{F} \rightarrow \abs{F}}{\isnuclear{j}}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
  Every nucleus is monotonic.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $F$ be a frame and $j : \abs{F} \rightarrow \abs{F}$ a nucleus on it.
  Let $x~y : \abs{F}$ and suppose $x \sqsubseteq y$. We need to show that $j(x) \sqsubseteq j(y)$.
  First, notice that $x = \meet{x}{y}$ by antisymmetry since $x \sqsubseteq \meet{x}{y}$ by the fact
  that $\meet{\_}{\_}$ is a greatest lower and $\meet{x}{y} \sqsubseteq y$ by the fact that it is a
  lower bound. The result can now be derived as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    j(x) &\quad\sqsubseteq\quad j(\meet{x}{y})                 && [x = \meet{x}{y}]                       \\
         &\quad\sqsubseteq\quad \meet{j(x)}{j(y)}              && [\text{meets are preserved}]            \\
         &\quad\sqsubseteq\quad {j(y)}                         && [\text{$\meet{}{}$ is a lower bound}]  .
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
  The set of fixed points of a nucleus forms a poset.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  \todo{
    Complete this rather trivial proof. The only interesting thing in it is antisymmetry.
  }
\end{proof}

Now, we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:fixed-point-frame}
  The set of fixed points for a nucleus forms a frame.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  \todo{
    Write and explain this proof completely and precisely.
  }
\end{proof}

In the next chapter, we will see now nuclei are useful for generating a frame with a given
formal topology.

%% As a brief digression, let us note that the reliance on the notion of ``black box''
%% perhaps gives the impression that this is a bizarre scenario that is not likely to occur
%% in real programming. We would like to stress that this is not the case. A program that the
%% programmer does not \emph{completely} grasp is essentially a black box; the distance
%% between the programmer's mental model of it and its actual behaviour has to be
%% investigated via experimentation. This is none other than the familiar process of
%% \emph{debugging a program} that is perhaps the only thing common to all kinds of
%% programming; programs do not come to exist in isolation, they come to exist through the
%% creative effort of a subject through the dialectical process of debugging~\cite{PDD}. This
%% discussion involving a black box can hence be taken to be about a program that behaves in
%% a way the programmer does not expect it to, meaning the programmer does not really know
%% ``what is inside''. Hence, the programmer must experiment with to understand the problem.
