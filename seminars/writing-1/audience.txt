The intended audience of this thesis is researchers in type theory and logic who are
mathematically oriented. The reader is expected to be interested in and have the necessary
background to understand univalent foundations. Although _topology_ is the main topic of
the thesis, it will be approached from the perspective of logic and computation enabling
the reader to understand it without a background in topology. I believe it to be a
significant challenge to explain the significance of topology to an audience that I do not
expect to have a background in topology.
