* Peer review for the thesis draft of Luca Bello
** pg. 1
   - "Rich mathematical structure": I more or less understand what you mean
     here but I think it would be better to stay away from such ambiguous
     expressions. The "richness" of mathematical structure can mean many
     different things to different  people.
** pg. 2
   - I really like the diagram in Figure 1.1.
** pg. 3
   - "The aim of this thesis is to solve these problems in the context of big
     data in a more efficient way": this seems to be a nice statement of your
     research question. However, I think it's a bit too strongly worded.
     Instead of saying "solve these problems", I think you should say
     something like "address these problems" or "consider solutions to these
     problems" and so on.
** pg. 4
   - The huge paragraphs should certainly be broken up into multiple
     paragraphs.
   - When you are listing properties of possible applications, it becomes
     quite hard to follow the sentence. Consider itemising this.
   - "the notation used is taken from [8]": some people hold the opinion that
     the text should be citation-invariant, that is, if you take out all the
     citations, the text should remain natural. Personally, I don't fully
     agree with this opinion and find what you have done in this sentence
     quite convenient. However, I do partially agree with this opinion in
     that, sometimes trying make the text citation-invariant can lead to more
     natural sentences. In addition, it can make things easier for your
     reader. For instance, someone who is familiar with the field of machine
     learning and data science would probably easily know what the reference
     [8] is if they saw the last name of the author so mentioning the last
     name directly in the text can save them from the trouble of checking the
     bibliography.
** pg. 7
   - "At this point...": rather a weak start for the chapter. It might be a
     good idea to start with something more direct.
   - "... is a good choice (e.g. autoregressive ...": it seems that you have
     typed `e.g. autoregressive` in LaTeX which resulted in an incorrect
     spacing after the dot, as LaTeX thinks that you are ending a sentence
     with the last dot in `e.g.`. The correct way to write this would be:
     `e.g.~autoregressive`.
** pg. 9
   - I really like the opening of Section 2.2! Very to-the-point and
     accessible.
** pg. 10
   - "bigger interest lies in": this expression doesn't seem idiomatic to me.
** pg. 14
   - "it's useful to thoroughly explain the calculations in [13]": it might be
     better to say something like "thoroughly examine the calculations". You
     are the one doing the explaining, not the reader, so this sounds a bit
     weird to me. If I understand it correctly, the _scenario_ one should have
     in mind in scientific writing is an exploration upon which the reader and
     the author are collaboratively embarking upon (which is, by the way, the
     justification of the "we" pronoun).
** pg. 15
   - There are some other instances of the citation-invariance issue I
     mentioned. It might be a good idea to review these and think about if
     they would benefit from a citation-invariant style.
** pg. 22
   - "Real numbers can have an unlimited amount of digits in their decimal
     expansion; it's easy to see the impossibility to keep all of them when
     storing a real number on a machine". I will not provide writing advice
     regarding this sentence, but a bit of technical advice as it's getting
     into my field of research. The notion that "we cannot store real numbers
     on computers" is a myth and it is a pet peeve of mine that people often
     say this. Let me clarify that I am in no way criticising your
     understanding, as I completely understand that this is a standard
     opinion.
     
     In computer science, we deal with a lot of things that are infinite and
     we can represent them on computers perfectly fine. An example: programs
     themselves. They certainly have _potentially_ infinite behaviour so one
     cannot attain a finite understanding of their behaviour, as seen from the
     outside world (i.e., by running the program, not examining its code). For
     instance, I could write you an interpreter, and there is no hope that you
     will be able to completely understand its behaviour since if you could,
     you would be able to solve the halting problem. Despite this, we often
     write _code_ that generates this infinite behaviour which is a completely
     finite thing and can be represented on a computer.
     
     If you think of real numbers as programs, there is nothing preventing you
     from representing _all digits_ of Ï€ on a computer, by writing its Taylor
     series expansion. This way, you can perform whatever operations you want
     to perform on real numbers. The problem arises when we want to observe
     these, not when we try to represent them!
     
     There is an entire sub-field (of programming language theory) called
     "exact real-number computation" devoted to representing real numbers on
     computers this way. The idea is that you can compute whatever real number
     you want, and at the end of day, when you want to see a _finite_
     approximation of it, you run this real number and get better and better
     approximations of it by waiting, which will be rational number. In this
     way, there are no "rounding errors" in the computation of the result; it
     is the *finite approximation* of the result that causes the rounding
     errors.

     Perhaps, the existence of such a sub-field deserves at least a mention
     here in your thesis?

     It is my genuine hope that people in machine learning learn a bit about
     these techniques as they would benefit immensely from them. Actually,
     I do sometimes wonder why they have not started applying these techniques
     yet.

** General remarks
   - There is something wrong with the paragraph spacing of your thesis. Some
     paragraphs do not seem to be indented.

** Conclusion
    - Overall, this is very good considering it's an early draft!
